          <section class="content"><p>“Aaron dead. World wanderers, we have lost a wise elder. Hackers for right, we are one down. Parents all, we have lost a child. Let us&nbsp;weep.”</p>
<p>I’ve spent a good chunk of the past weekend obsessed with the case of Aaron Swartz. I couldn’t help to read every bit of news, every opinion, every blog post he&nbsp;wrote.</p>
<p>His story is a tragedy from any point of view. A young, uncannily brilliant individual whose irreverence scared the shit out of established powers. Since last year, he was being brutally prosecuted for allegedly illegally downloading millions of academic papers from the <span class="caps">MIT</span> system into his laptop, supposedly with the intention of distributing them&nbsp;freely.</p>
<p>Aaron was 26 years old when he took his life. He had struggled with depression for a very long time, and a process that was going to cost him millions of dollars that he didn’t have and potentially tens of years in jail pushed that depression to a&nbsp;limit.</p>
<p>Aaron Swartz was as committed to the idea of free information as one can be. He was prodigious from an insulting young age and he could have transformed his genius and drive into money with ease. But he wasn’t interested in that. All the projects he ever engaged in seemed to be for a greater, better idea he had of society and he only wanted to work to get there.&nbsp;aaronswartz</p>
<p>At this point in the century we have to understand one simple thing about young culture. It is not 20<span class="ord">th</span> century young culture. This century works differently. This means no more Sid Vicious, Jimi Hendrixs or Kurt Cobains. Music stopped creating ideological revolutionaries a long time ago. This does not mean that youth has stopped driving change and disrupting thought, culture and art. But we may have to look in places that are not music to find role&nbsp;models.</p>
<p>Although he took his own life for a combination of reasons we’ll never know about, there was a naivety and extreme idealism in his approach to life. Being idealism a sort of optimism, I can’t help but feeling a painful contradiction in Swartz&nbsp;case.</p>
