          <section class="content"><p>Today I’m feeling a bit overwhelmed. By awesomeness, but definitely overwhelmed. At <span class="caps">SFPC</span>, we’ve been in touch with so many ideas, experiences, languages, that it is already all a bit difficult to absorb and&nbsp;process.</p>
<p>The hard part for me is not only that, but the fact that absorbing all these new inputs has my mind flying around like a butterfly from idea to idea, without really committing to any of&nbsp;them.</p>
<p>Maybe that’s what it’s supposed to be. I can acknowledge the value of focusing on learning, processing, exercising around a whole lot of ideas, getting your mind trained into thinking and reflecting about all of this. There is a whole lot of value I’m already feeling on thinking about systems in a playful, creative way. I find myself <em>unlearning</em> the way I usually think about projects, and it feels very&nbsp;inspiring.</p>
<p>However, I feel a little anxious when I see my mind wandering so much and can sense the possibility of not even <em>producing</em> anything solid at the end that I can present to myself as a tangible&nbsp;output.</p>
<p>I’ve been trying to list out what was realistic to expect from <span class="caps">SFPC</span> in those terms, and was&nbsp;not.</p>
<p><strong>Unrealistic</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Get proficient in any new&nbsp;language.</li>
<li>Produce one, two, three pieces of middle complexity to show, when you’ve never actually worked in that&nbsp;context.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Realistic</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Get in touch with a whole lot of&nbsp;languages.</li>
<li>Learn to think conceptually about computing, about&nbsp;programming.</li>
<li>Get a hang of other angles to this (experience design, performance art,&nbsp;installations).</li>
<li>Produce a couple of proof of concepts of realms you never actually produced anything&nbsp;for.</li>
<li>Do a lot of&nbsp;writing.</li>
<li>Document artists, tools, career&nbsp;paths.</li>
<li>Make honest, intersting, genuine&nbsp;connections.</li>
</ul>
