<p>“I am offered the Grand Inquisitor’s choice. Will you choose freedom without happiness, or happiness without freedom? The only answer one can make, I think is:&nbsp;No.”</p>
<p>“With all our self-consciousness, we have very little sense of where we live, where we are right here right&nbsp;now.”</p>
<p>“It seems that the utopian imagination is trapped, like capitalism and industrialism and the human population, in a one-way future consisting only of&nbsp;growth.”</p>
<p>“[The utopia of the Grand Inquisitor] is the product of the <strong>euclidean mind</strong> (a phrase Dostoyevsky used often), which is obsessed by the idea of regulating of regulating all life by reason and bringing happiness to man whatever the&nbsp;cost.”</p>
<p>Utopia has been euclidean, it has been European, and it has been masculine. I am trying to suggest, in an evasive, distrustful, untrustworthy fashion, and as obscurely as I can, that our final loss of faith in that radiant sandcastle may enable our eyes to adjust to a dimmer light and in it perceive another kind of&nbsp;utopia.</p>
<p>“[We must believe] that through the exercise of their reason men can control and in major ways alter for the better their social environment… One must have faith of a kind that our history has made completely inaccessible.”
<em>Bob&nbsp;Elliott</em></p>
<p>“Totalitarianism is not only hell, but also the dream of paradise — the age old dream of a world where everybody would dream in harmony, united by a single common will and faith, without secrets from one another… If totalitarianism did not exploit these archetypes, which are deep inside us all and rooted deep in all religions, it could never attract so many people, especially during the early phases of its existence. “
<em>Milan&nbsp;Kundera</em></p>
<p>“The purer, the more euclidean the reason that builds a utopia, the greater its self-destructive capacity. I submit that our lack of faith in the benevolence of reason as the controlling power is well&nbsp;founded.”</p>
<p>“Lévi-Strauss [makes the distinction][…] between the <em>hot</em> societies, which have appeared since the Neolithic Revolution, and in which <em>differentiations between castes and between classes are urged without cease, in order that social change and energy may be extracted from them</em>, and the <em>cold</em> societies, self-limited, whose historical temperature is pretty near&nbsp;zero.”</p>
<p>[Talking about <em>The Dispossessed</em>] “Anarchism rejects the identification of civilization with the state, and the identification of power with coercion; against the inherent violence of the <em>hot</em> society it asserts the value of such antisocial behavior as the general refusal of women to bear arms in war; and other coyote&nbsp;devices.” </p>
<p>[This is mine: What is she talking about? Women in anarchist movements are leaders and more fighters than in any other political movement. I must be misunderstanding what she meant with this&nbsp;paragraph.]</p>
<p>“They are assailed by too many new things ever to find the depths in the old before it has gone by. The rush of life past them they call progress, though it is too rapid for them to move with it. Man remains the same, baffled and astonished, with a heap of new things around him but gone before he knows them. Men may live many sorts of lives, and this they call <em>opportunity</em>,and believe opportunity good without ever examining any one of those lives to know if it is good. We have fewer ways of life and most of us never know but one.” 
<em>Lord&nbsp;Dorn</em></p>
<p>“I don’t think we’re ever going to get to utopia again by going forward, but only roundabout or&nbsp;sideways.”</p>
<h3 id="the-left-hand-of-darkness">The left hand of&nbsp;darkness</h3>
<p>“I talk about the gods, I am an atheist. But I am an artist too, and therefore a liar. Distrust everything I say. I am telling the truth. The only truth I can understand or express is, logically defined, a lie. Psychologically defined, a symbol. Aesthetically defined, a&nbsp;metaphor.”</p>
