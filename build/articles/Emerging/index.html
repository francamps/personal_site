<p>2008 financial crisis, and especially the economical policy implemented to mitigate by political bodies, revealed deep gaps in democracy quality in a lot of countries. These policies had specific effects for the south of&nbsp;Europe.</p>
<p>Coincidentally, a wave fo technological social tools has been readily available for those movements that sprung after the&nbsp;crash.</p>
<p>Similarly as the protocols on the Internet provides the illusion of a horizontal, level field in communications that where individual hosts self-organize and hierarchical power structures of the past are no longer&nbsp;applicable</p>
<p>, this is also an illusion that has affected social and political movements emerging in the recent times, and especially after&nbsp;2008.</p>

<p>social and political movements that gained relevance after the crash found themselves with a power for organization that could outdo the articulation of their&nbsp;discourse,</p>
<p>Movements like Egyptian Revolution in 2011, the 15M Movement in Spain or OccupyWallStreet in the <span class="caps">US</span> spend a significant amount of energy and resources in defining the structure of their own movement as well as articulation a common&nbsp;discourse. </p>

<p>In parallel to political debates, and attempts to articulate specific demands around a common discourse, the debate around structure and leardership, collective decision-making in the movement was one of the most active. Some of the structure political entities emerging from that&nbsp;movement.</p>
<p>The perception of corruption in the country’s business and political elite made overcoming the lack of accountability and transparency one of the common debates. Therefore, the need for structures that made the wrongdoing of political and business elites accountable to&nbsp;citizens</p>
<p>Although structurelessness never seemed to be a desirable goal, the debate about leaderlessness was central. Introducing structures and process to improve accountability and minimize the negative impact of an&nbsp;elite</p>
