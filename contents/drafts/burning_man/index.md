Burning Man is becoming a major cultural / counter cultural reference in the world today. Every aspect and event in the cultural world has been corporatized to the deepest level, including shows, festivals and every possible music-related event. It's not a secret that music has no countercultural influence anymore.

In this environment, the influence of BurningMan as a safe haven for radical ideas has only been growing in the most recent years, to a point that the cultural elite seems unable to ignore anymore. 

BurningMan is a enormous human gathering in the desert of Nevada that get together to shape the ephemeral Black Rock City and comit to live under a set of utopian rules, based on self-reliance, gifting and creativity. Financial transactions and corporate use of the event's name, location or any related information is completely banned. 

The natural environment is very rough. Nature doesn't want humans around the area, and the extreme heat, dryness and dusty storms are in charge of continuously reminding participants they are to fight against nature to stay there.

It is a rough environment, and an expensive and complicated endeavour. So much so, it self-selects the audience comprehensively.

BurningMan has been attracting more of the elite than the hippies it used to attract years ago. It creates a strange dychotomy between the older generations of burners and the new ones, closer to urban, creative high paid jobs than the experimental, radical hippies of their older counterparts.

BM keeps everybody's state of mind very in sync. There has been a lot of chatter of the increased influx of wealthy people on the playa. Rich people have a tendency of fucking everything they touch up, so the concern is understandable.
