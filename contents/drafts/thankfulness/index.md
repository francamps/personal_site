Leaving in NY is intense. A lot of stuff happens to and around you. The very high density of events that you go through just by existing makes your cognitive abilities behave in a different way than in some other places.

<span class="more"></span>

One of the consequences is the perception of a diminished capacity of recall (<i>disclaimer: also because Internet</i>). This perception comes from the fact that your mind needs to strengthen its capacity to filter out in order to have a normal life, which makes normally non-minor events become a weaker memory.

So by the end of last year, one of the best years of my life, I made the effort of going through all the memories I had and make a list of 'Whats' and a list of 'Whos'. That list was an effort for me to be aware of the people and situations who had been relevant to my happiness, and a way to praise all of them for it. It's unfair how much I have to thank and how rarely I do.

This year, I wanted to bring it up one level. I wanted to make it public in a slightly more sophisticated way, take a look at who and what and where I was feeling blessed in a way that I could encourage people to do the same. I also decided to include people I don't know but who have definitely inspired me in one way or another.

Finally, once it is all done, I decided to make a little exploration about who thanked, what they do and where they are.

By concept:

* 4 relatives
* 10 friends
* 2 "friends"
* 2 DJs
* 1 singer
* 1 blogger
* 1 politician / activist
* 1 company
* 1 thought leader, writer, something else
* 1 conference organizer
* 1 Hacker camp organizer
* 1 neighborhood
* 1 million people who work for others pro bono
* That one africanamerican girl who asked to make a phone call on my phone in New Orleans, made me hesitate and immediately after realize how subtle forms racism are alive everywhere. Thank you for not giving up on white entitled fucks like me and making us confront our own shit. Beliving that we can do better. I give you my word I'm already trying harder since then.
