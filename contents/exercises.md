*"I talk about the gods, I am an atheist. But I am an artist too, and therefore a liar. Distrust everything I say. I am telling the truth. The only truth I can understand or express is, logically defined, a lie. Psychologically defined, a symbol. Aestheticaly defined, a metaphor."*

--Ursula K Le Guin, *The left hand of darkness*

### Binary card calculator

Conceived as a supporting tool for a workshop on binary card built by Toru Urakawa, the binary card calculator is used to translate from binary numbers, represented by up or down black and white cards, to decimal numbers, which are presented as big bubbly numbers.
