I'm Franc Camps-Febrer. I am a data visualization artist working for [@Knewton](http://www.twitter.com/knewton), the adaptive learning platform. I also do freelance work when I believe it'll make the world better. I am passionate about all things storytelling, and exploring combinations of formats to tell more powerful stories.

I was born in Barcelona and I currently live in Brooklyn, NY, close to the center of the world.

I've worked as a bunch of different things, but most importantly as researcher, teacher, designer and developer. I've always done writing for various purposes. I earned a master degree in Developmental Neuroscience from CUNY in 2011, and focused my master's thesis on neuroaesthetics, synaesthesia and the emergence of creative thinking based on research work I collaborated with at NYU's Center for Neural Science. I also shot a documentary about it.

Late 2011, I started pursuing my interests in visualization, interaction, design and development full-time. Putting all my experiences together, I like to think I have both a qualitative and quantitative approach to storytelling.

I'll be a School for Poetic Computation alumni starting October 2014.

I love notebooks and their inhabitants: lists, sketches, idea maps.

I have an opinion.

Send me a line to francamps.at.gmail.com or [tweet](http://www.twitter.com/francamps) at me.

PS: I'm also a big electronic music aficionado, and I keep adding stuff I like to my [SoundCloud](http://www.soundcloud.com/lucidsi/favorites).
