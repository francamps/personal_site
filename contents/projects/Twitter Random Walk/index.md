This was more of an excuse to learn a bit of Node.js and about Twitter bots. I use Twitter quite a lot, and I reached a point where I was reaching a certain information overload. I attributed it to the fact that I was following too many people. I decided to declare Twitter bankrupcy, but before I was going to do an experiment with the people I followed.

I decided to degrade my Twitter experience by unfollowing one by one the accounts I followed and following one of the accounts these followed. Very progressively. The idea was to feel a transformation of the experience, and seeing how by losing personalization I would slowly feel more alienated, less engaged, and actually get work done, while at the same time breaking out of my filter bubble.

After a few weeks I did find my twitter way less engaging, but some tweets were just fascinating and it made me wonder all I may be missing out there.
